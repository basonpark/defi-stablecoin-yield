              Lumina Finance is a decentralized lending platform built on Ethereum (specifically, the Sepolia testnet for now!).
              Our mission? To let you leverage your ETH holdings in exciting new ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              Think of it like this: You deposit your ETH as collateral, and in return, you can borrow our native stablecoin, <strong className="font-semibold">LuminaCoin (LMC)</strong>.
              But wait, there's more! You can also stake your ETH directly to earn yield generated by the protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's all powered by a set of transparent, automated smart contracts working together like a well-oiled (digital) machine.

                LMC is our very own ERC20 token, designed to maintain a stable value (pegged 1:1 to USD, notionally).
                It's the currency you borrow and repay within the system. Crucially, LMC is only <strong className="font-semibold">minted</strong> when users borrow against their collateral and <strong className="font-semibold">burned</strong> when loans are repaid, ensuring its value is always backed.

                Want to earn some passive income on your ETH? This is the place! The Staking Pool allows users to directly stake their ETH.
                In return, they earn a share of rewards distributed to the pool (these rewards might come from protocol fees or external funding in different versions).
                You can <strong className="font-semibold">stake</strong>, <strong className="font-semibold">unstake</strong>, and <strong className="font-semibold">claim</strong> your earned ETH rewards through this contract.
                Your reward share is calculated based on how much you've staked relative to the total amount in the pool.

            <p>
              Okay, let's talk numbers! The most crucial calculation in Lumina is the <strong className="font-semibold">Health Factor (HF)</strong>.
              It's a single number that represents the safety of your loan. Think of it as a buffer protecting you (and the protocol) from liquidation if the value of your collateral drops.
            </p>
            <Alert variant="default" className="bg-blue-50 border-blue-200 text-blue-800">
              <ShieldCheck className="h-4 w-4 !text-blue-600" />
              <AlertTitle>Why is Health Factor Important?</AlertTitle>
              <AlertDescription>
                If your Health Factor drops below <strong className="font-semibold">{minHealthFactor.toFixed(1)}</strong>, your position becomes eligible for liquidation.
                Keeping your HF healthy (above {minHealthFactor.toFixed(1)}) is key to avoiding this!
              </AlertDescription>
            </Alert>
            <p>Here's the magic formula:</p>
            <MathFormula>
              Health Factor = (Total Collateral Value in USD * Liquidation Threshold) / Total Debt Value in USD
            </MathFormula>
            <p>Let's break it down:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
              <li>
                <strong className="font-semibold">Total Collateral Value (USD):</strong> This is the current market value of your deposited ETH.
                <MathFormula>ETH Deposited * Current ETH/USD Price</MathFormula>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="font-semibold">Liquidation Threshold:</strong> This is a safety parameter set by the protocol (currently <strong className="font-semibold">{liquidationThresholdPercent}%</strong>).
                It represents the maximum percentage of your collateral's value that can be covered by debt before liquidation risk increases significantly. It's applied as a multiplier (e.g., {liquidationThresholdPercent}% = {liquidationThresholdPercent / 100}).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="font-semibold">Total Debt Value (USD):</strong> This is the total amount of LMC you've borrowed. Since LMC aims for a 1 USD peg, this is simply:
                <MathFormula>LMC Borrowed Amount</MathFormula>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong className="font-semibold">Example:</strong> You deposit 1 ETH when ETH = $3000. Your Collateral Value is $3000.
              You borrow 1000 LMC. Your Debt Value is $1000.
            </p>
            <MathFormula>
              HF = ($3000 * {liquidationThresholdPercent / 100}) / $1000 = ${(3000 * (liquidationThresholdPercent / 100) / 1000).toFixed(2)}
            </MathFormula>
            <p>
              Since ${(3000 * (liquidationThresholdPercent / 100) / 1000).toFixed(2)} is comfortably above {minHealthFactor.toFixed(1)}, your position is healthy!
              If the ETH price dropped significantly, your Collateral Value would decrease, lowering your Health Factor.
              You can improve your HF by repaying LMC or depositing more ETH.

              Beyond borrowing, Lumina offers a way to put your ETH to work directly through the <strong className="font-semibold">StakingPool</strong> contract.
              It's simple: you lock up some ETH in the pool, and you start earning rewards.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong className="font-semibold">How do rewards work?</strong> The pool accumulates ETH rewards over time (these could be sourced from protocol fees in the future, but for now, they might be added manually for testing).
              The contract keeps track of a <code className="relative rounded bg-muted px-[0.3rem] py-[0.2rem] font-mono text-sm">rewardPerToken</code> metric, which increases as more rewards are added.
              Your claimable reward is calculated based on your staked amount and the change in <code className="relative rounded bg-muted px-[0.3rem] py-[0.2rem] font-mono text-sm">rewardPerToken</code> since you last interacted (staked, unstaked, or claimed).
            </p>
            <p>Essentially, the more you stake and the longer you stake for, the larger your share of the distributed rewards will be.</p>

               <AlertDescription>
                 Calculating a precise Annual Percentage Yield (APY) can be complex and depends on the rate rewards are added to the pool and the total amount staked.
                 The dashboard currently shows your raw earned rewards, not a projected APY.
